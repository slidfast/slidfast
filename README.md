slidfast, born from [this article](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/optimization-and-performance/) and hardened within the JBoss RichFaces project, is based on the book [HTML5 Architecture](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024088.do) on O'Reilly media.
All the examples and code are detailed in the book.

This framework is well commented and documented so that you can learn. It is focused on the 5
HTML5 features/specs that are widely supported across all modern browsers:

* Web Storage
* Web Socket
* Geolocation
* Orientation
* Web Workers
